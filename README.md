<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

We're in that *in between* stage of the Covid pandemic: things are slowly starting to reopen, and we flock to the old-made-new experiences we've missed while being cooped up in apartment buildings staring at the walls.

That's where *Coffee Time* comes in.

One of the most mundane yet sorely missed experiences is the ability to complain about the line at the Starbucks, and the unnecessarily complex order the person right before you chucked into the queue, slowing down what was surely going to be a productive morning.

But re-opening cafes for customers to walk in and order is a time-intensive and expensive endeavor, though it does come with a high reward (*up to 300% increase in sales!*). There are, however, employees to rehire and retrain, infrastructure to put in place, and social distancing queues to organize in every space.

That's why it's important to identify which cafe locations will see an increase in traffic at a faster pace over the rest of 2021, and focus attention and resources towards making the most of this reopening season.

With this intention in mind, **Coffee Time** uses current MTA data to track the increase in traffic at the top stations in Manhattan, focusing on the ones that are seeing a bigger % increase in traffic over others.

By comparing the traffic levels at each location in 2021 to the traffic seen pre-pandemic in 2019, we can gauge potential for increase, as well as the  recovery of foot traffic.


# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

This project uses Python packages: pandas, numpy, request, os, seaborn, bokeh, sqlalchemy and plt to visualize MTA traffic data and identify trends in foot traffic growth in the late summer of 2021.

With this data, we can identify the top 20 Starbucks location in Manhattan to open, priority identified by proximity to the MTA stations with the fastest growing foot traffic.

# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README.
